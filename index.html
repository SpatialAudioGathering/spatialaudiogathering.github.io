            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Spatial audio has become a crucial component in music and audio production: from cinema to AR/VR, and from video games to electronic and media arts, it is, nowadays, an essential feature expanding the way we perceive and understand sound and music and opening new possibilities for artists and designers. For this reason and due to the ubiquitous and fast diffusion that spatial audio witnessed in the academic and research context and the commercial one alike, many new technologies for spatialisation have been developed and released in the last two decades, each with their characteristic features.</p>
            <p>Given the importance of spatial audio today, this event aims to create an opening and welcoming forum of discussion and confrontation on themes all-around spatial audio, encompassing both a theoretical and practical/artistic perspective. The event, providing the participants with talks and listening sessions, especially targets the ones novel to the context of spatial audio such as students and early-stage researchers, but equally welcomes scholars and practitioners with a long-standing interest and usage of spatial audio technologies.</p>
