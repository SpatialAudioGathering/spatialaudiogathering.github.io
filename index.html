        <h1>SAG - Spatial Audio Gathering</h1>
        <h4>
            March 31—April 1, 2026<br>

        <section id="about">
            <h2>Spatial audio</h2>
            <p>Spatial audio has become a crucial component in modern music and sound production. From cinema and video games to AR/VR and media arts, it is now an essential feature that expands how we perceive and understand sound, opening new creative possibilities for artists and designers. Given its rapid diffusion in both academic research and commercial applications, a wide range of new spatialisation technologies have been developed over the last two decades, each with its own unique characteristics, calling for comprehensive studies beyond the technical perspective.</p>

            <h2>The conference</h2>
            <p>Launched in 2024, SAG was established as a central hub for scholars, artists, enthusiasts, and practitioners in the field of spatial audio. The conference aims to foster communication and exchange between a wide-ranging audience, featuring contributions from both renowned academics and early-career researchers. As spatial audio gains momentum, SAG seeks to create a thriving environment for the circulation of ideas encompassing technical perspectives, artistic applications, aesthetic studies, and philosophical research. By bringing together a diverse community, SAG strives to bridge the gaps within the scope of spatial audio and its international community, gathering–as the name suggests–makers, artists, and scholars, and creating an open and welcoming forum for discussion and collaboration.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>We invite authors to submit proposals that explore the spatiality of sound, in line with the core focus of the conference. For this edition, we are especially interested in contributions that offer personal reflections and investigate real-world use-cases. We welcome submissions from a variety of perspectives, including technical, artistic, and philosophical. In addition to traditional theoretical research, we highly encourage artistic submissions showcasing the use of spatial audio.</p>

        <section id="talks">
            <h3>Talks and poster presentations</h3>
            <p>For both presentation types, authors are required to submit a fully-anonymised extended abstract of no more than 500 words, using the provided LaTeX template that can be edited with a local LaTeX installation or an online tool like Overleaf. To ensure consistency in the proceedings, no Word template will be provided. The submitted document should be written in British English and should contain:
            <ul>
                <li>An abstract of the research and 3 to 5 keywords</li>
                <li>A main body of text outlining the proposal (including methodologies, processes, and outcomes, where relevant)</li>
                <li>A list of references</li>
            </ul>
            Please note: abstract, keywords, and references do not count towards the 500-word limit. Authors will be asked to state their preferred presentation mode when submitting their proposal. Please note, however, that reviewers may suggest an alternative format:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><u>Talks (long papers):</u></strong> authors will have a 15-minute presentation slot with a 5-minute Q&A. Talks may be presented remotely. Selected authors will be required to expand their extended abstract into a camera-ready full paper up to 4 pages (excluding references)</li>
                    <li><strong><u>Posters (short papers):</u></strong> will be presented during dedicated sessions and coffee breaks. Posters are an excellent way to showcase early-stage research in a relaxed setting, providing great networking opportunities. Selected authors must attend in person and bring their own poster (A0 format: 841 x 1189 mm). Demos may be showcased alongside the poster. Authors with a poster presentation will be required to expand their extended abstract into a camera-ready short paper up to 2 pages (excluding references)</li>
                </ul>
                All camera-ready papers will be included in the conference proceedings and published with a DOI.</p>

        <section id="art">
            <h3>Artistic submissions</h3>
            <p>We welcome artistic submissions that use or foster reflection on the broader topic of spatial audio. Submissions may fall into one of the following categories:
                <ul>
                    <li><u><strong>Acousmatic music:</u></strong> selected submissions will be performed in the Ambisonics Theatre at LBU. Submissions should be no longer than 10 minutes. Longer proposals (up to 15 minutes) may be considered on a case-by-case basis. If the submission is multichannel, authors are required to provide a stereo reduction of the piece for the peer-review process</li>
                    <li><u><strong>Multimedia works:</u></strong> audiovisual works will be screened in the Dolby Atmos Cinema at LBU. Proposals should be no longer than 10 minutes. Pieces up to 15 minutes may be exceptionally evaluated on a case-by-case basis. If the audiovisual submission has multichannel audio, authors are required to provide a stereo reduction for the peer-review process</li>
                    <li><u><strong>Performance:</u></strong> performances may last up to 20 minutes. Proposals up to 30 minutes may be considered on a case-by-case basis. Authors must clearly outline the connection of the performance to spatial audio. Performances can be of any genre (including, but not limited to, live coding, live electronics, and mixed music). However, please note that logistical constraints will be taken into account during the peer-review process. Authors are required to bring all of their own personal equipment, as well as performers if needed. Proposals for live performances must be accompanied by sufficient audiovisual documentation for the peer-review process</li>
                </ul>
                Authors submitting to the artistic tracks should use the same LaTeX template as the scientific proposals, but the document <strong>should not</strong> be anonymised. All artistic submissions must contain:
                <ul>
                    <li>Author(s)' list, including affiliations where relevant</li>
                    <li>Submission type (e.g., acousmatic, audiovisual, live performance)</li>
                    <li>Programme notes of no more than 350 words</li>
                    <li>Author(s)' bios and, where relevant, performer(s)' bios of no more than 300 words</li>
                    <li>Tech and logistic requirements, if relevant</li>
                    <li>Connection to, and use of spatial audio (especially for live performances)</li>
                    <li>Non-expiring, accessible links to the artwork (e.g., Drive, Dropbox) and stereo reductions if relevant</li>
                </ul> 
                For selected artworks, author(s)' and performer(s)' bios, along with programme notes, will be published in the conference proceedings. While high-quality MP3s are accepted as stereo reductions for the peer-review process, the final artwork should have FHD 16:9 video and 44.1 kHz/24 bit audio. Please note that inaccessible files or expiring links will result in a desk-reject of the proposal.</p>

            <h2>General information</h2>
            <h3>Conference fee</h3>
            <p>Authors whose proposals are accepted will be required to register for the conference and pay a fee. The amount will be announced at a later date, but will be kept as low as possible to ensure the accessibility of the event. While performers and co-authors are not required to register, each accepted proposal must be linked to a single, distinct registration.</p>
            <h3>Attending the event (general public)</h3>
            <p>The event will be open to the general public upon registering and paying the conference fee. Leeds Beckett University students and staff will be admitted free of charge.</p>
            <h3>Remote presentation</h3>
            <p>We strongly encourage in-person participation to foster community building and networking. However, we understand this may not be feasible for some international authors. For this reason, we will accommodate remote presentations for talks and fixed media proposals. Please note that only authors selected for poster presentations or live performances are required to attend in person. The conference fee is mandatory for all selected authors, including those presenting remotely.</p>
            <h3>Travel and stay in Leeds</h3>
            <p>Accommodation and travel costs are the responsibility of the authors. While we are unfortunately unable to offer financial support, we will compile a list of helpful information regarding your stay in Leeds. Additionally, we will provide official acceptance letters to selected overseas authors who wish to present in person.</p>
