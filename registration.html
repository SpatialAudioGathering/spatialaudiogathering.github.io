    <h2>Conference Registration</h2>
    <p>
            <p>SAG 2026 attendees will be required to register to the event and pay a 20£ conference fee. This will grant access to all the sessions (presentations, keynotes, concerts) and refreshments. The fee applies to both the general public attending the conference (non-presenting) and to selected authors. For each selected submission, at least one author must register by the deadline (see "important dates" section). For selected authors, the fee is one-time, meaning that multiple submissions will be covered by one registration. A link to the registration page will be provided in due course.</p> 
			<h3>Attending the concerts</h3>
            <p>Attending the evening concerts (Day 1 and Day 2) will be free of charge for registered attendees. Individuals not registered to the conference and willing to attend the concerts sessions only will be required to secure their place by registering separately and paying a 5£ per-concert fee.</p>
			<h3>Waivers</h3>
            <p>Fee waivers for attending the conference free of charge will be available to LBU staff and students. Registration will be required anyways for logistic reasons.</p>
            <h3>Remote presentation and attendance</h3>
			<p>While we strongly encourage in-person participation to foster community building and networking, we understand this may not be feasible for some international authors. For this reason, we will accommodate remote presentations for talks and fixed media proposals. Please note that authors selected for poster presentations or live performances will be required to attend in person. Authors presenting remotely will be required to pay the conference fee, and the same applies to the general public attending remotely. Please note that we will be able to stream only talks and keynotes.</p>         
            <h3>Travel and stay in Leeds</h3>
            <p>Accommodation and travel costs are the responsibility of the authors. While we are unfortunately unable to offer financial support, we will compile a list of helpful information regarding your stay in Leeds. Additionally, we will provide official acceptance letters to selected overseas authors who wish to present in person.</p>
