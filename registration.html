    <h2 class="header">Conference Registration</h2>
    <p>
            <p>SAG 2026 attendees will be required to register to the event and pay a £20 conference fee. This will grant access to all the sessions (presentations, keynotes, concerts) and refreshments. The fee applies to both the general public attending the conference (non-presenting) and to selected authors. For each selected submission, at least one author must register by the deadline (see "important dates" section). For selected authors, the fee is one-time, meaning that multiple submissions will be covered by one registration. A link to the registration page will be provided in due course.</p> 
			<h3 class="header right">Waivers</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>LBU students and staff are eligible to attend the conference free of charge</li>
				<li>SEAMUS affiliates may be issued a fee waiver to attend the conference, regardless of their status as presenting authors or general public. SEAMUS kindly sponsored 10 fee waivers, which are issued on a first come-first served basis</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In both cases, registering to the conference is compulsory. Delegates interested in taking advantage of a waiver are required to contact the conference organising committee attaching a proof of their LBU affiliation or SEAMUS membership. A bonus code will be issued if conditions are met.</p> 
            <h3 class="header">Remote presentation and attendance</h3>
			<p>While we strongly encourage in-person participation to foster community building and networking, we understand this may not be feasible for some international authors. For this reason, we will accommodate remote presentations for talks and fixed media proposals. Please note that authors selected for poster presentations or live performances will be required to attend in person. Authors presenting remotely will be required to pay the conference fee, and the same applies to the general public attending remotely. Please note that we will be able to stream only talks and keynotes.</p>         
            <h3 class="header right">Travel and stay in Leeds</h3>
            <p>Accommodation and travel costs are the responsibility of the authors. While we are unfortunately unable to offer financial support, we have collated a list of useful information in the <a href="https://spatialaudiogathering.github.io/directions.html">Direction</a> page for those attending the conference in person. We can provide official acceptance letters for those travelling from overseas and in need of such a document.</p>
