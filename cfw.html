            <p>We invite authors to submit proposals that explore the spatiality of sound, in line with the core focus of the conference. For this edition, we are especially interested in contributions that offer personal reflections and investigate real-world use-cases. We welcome submissions from a variety of perspectives, including technical, artistic, and philosophical. In addition to traditional theoretical research, we highly encourage artistic submissions showcasing the use of spatial audio.</p>
            <p>The special theme of SAG 2026 will be <strong>making spatial audio</strong>. Therefore we especially encourage submissions dealing with the following themes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>DIY approaches to spatial audio</li>
                    <li>New instruments for spatial audio control and recording</li>
                    <li>New systems for the diffusion of spatialised sound</li>
                    <li>Innovative spatial audio software (control, generation, transformation, acoustics)</li>
                    <li>Novel compositional techniques for spatialisation</li>
                </ul>

        <section id="talks">
            <h3 class="header right">Talks and poster presentations</h3>
            <p>For both presentation types, authors are required to submit a fully-anonymised extended abstract of no more than 500 words, using the provided LaTeX template that can be edited with a local LaTeX installation or an online tool like Overleaf. To ensure consistency in the proceedings, no Word template will be provided. The submitted document should be written in British English and should contain:
            <ul>
                <li>An abstract of the research and 3 to 5 keywords</li>
                <li>A main body of text outlining the proposal (including methodologies, processes, and outcomes, where relevant)</li>
                <li>A list of references</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please note: abstract, keywords, and references do not count towards the 500-word limit. Authors will be asked to state their preferred presentation mode when submitting their proposal. Please note, however, that reviewers may suggest an alternative format:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><u>Talks (long papers):</u></strong> authors will have a 15-minute presentation slot with a 5-minute Q&A. Talks may be presented remotely. Selected authors will be required to expand their extended abstract into a camera-ready full paper (4 to 8 pages excluding references)</li>
                    <li><strong><u>Posters (short papers):</u></strong> will be presented during dedicated sessions and coffee breaks. Posters are an excellent way to showcase early-stage research in a relaxed setting, providing great networking opportunities. Selected authors must attend in person and bring their own poster (A0 format: 841 x 1189 mm). Demos may be showcased alongside the poster. Authors with a poster presentation will be required to expand their extended abstract into a camera-ready short paper up to 4 pages (excluding references)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All camera-ready papers will be included in the conference proceedings and published with a DOI.</p>

        <section id="art">
            <h3 class="header">Artistic submissions</h3>
            <p>We welcome artistic submissions that use or foster reflection on the broader topic of spatial audio. Submissions may fall into one of the following categories:
                <ul>
                    <li><u><strong>Acousmatic music:</u></strong> selected submissions will be performed in the Ambisonics Theatre at LBU. Submissions should be no longer than 10 minutes. Longer proposals (up to 15 minutes) may be considered on a case-by-case basis. If the submission is multichannel, authors are required to provide a stereo reduction of the piece for the peer-review process</li>
                    <li><u><strong>Multimedia works:</u></strong> audiovisual works will be screened in the Dolby Atmos Cinema at LBU. Proposals should be no longer than 10 minutes. Pieces up to 15 minutes may be exceptionally evaluated on a case-by-case basis. If the audiovisual submission has multichannel audio, authors are required to provide a stereo reduction for the peer-review process</li>
                    <li><u><strong>Performance:</u></strong> performances may last up to 20 minutes. Proposals up to 30 minutes may be considered on a case-by-case basis. Authors must clearly outline the connection of the performance to spatial audio. Performances can be of any genre (including, but not limited to, live coding, live electronics, and mixed music). However, please note that logistical constraints will be taken into account during the peer-review process. Authors are required to bring all of their own personal equipment, as well as performers if needed. Proposals for live performances must be accompanied by sufficient audiovisual documentation for the peer-review process</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Authors submitting to the artistic tracks should use the same LaTeX template as the scientific proposals, but the document <strong>should not</strong> be anonymised. All artistic submissions must contain:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Author(s)' list, including affiliations where relevant</li>
                    <li>Submission type (e.g., acousmatic, audiovisual, live performance)</li>
                    <li>Programme notes of no more than 350 words</li>
                    <li>Author(s)' bios and, where relevant, performer(s)' bios of no more than 300 words</li>
                    <li>Tech and logistic requirements, if relevant</li>
                    <li>Connection to, and use of spatial audio (especially for live performances)</li>
                    <li>Non-expiring, accessible links to the artwork (e.g., Drive, Dropbox) and stereo reductions if relevant</li>
                </ul> 
                <p>For selected artworks, author(s)' and performer(s)' bios, along with programme notes, will be published in the conference proceedings. While high-quality MP3s are accepted as stereo reductions for the peer-review process, the final artwork should have FHD 16:9 video and 44.1 kHz/24 bit audio. Please note that inaccessible files or expiring links will result in a desk-reject of the proposal.</p>

        Here&rsquo;s where you can put directions to the conference,
        and other information that will help attendees find the location,
        and find the building, and register, and find local places they can stay, etc.
        You can embed a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google Maps</a> iframe
        with directions to the conference like a did below.
        It can also be helpful to include maps of the campus itself,
        or pictures of the building the conference will be held in.
        I&rsquo;ve opted to use a placeholder image of a kitten below.
